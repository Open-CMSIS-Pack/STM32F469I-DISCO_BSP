List of things TO DO on this pack:

- Board Layer must be reviewed

- README.md files must be reviewed

- resolve SDIO problem
  CubeMX creates 'HAL_SD_ConfigWideBusOperation(&hsd, SDIO_BUS_WIDE_4B)' function call in main.c
  this function call returns always with error but I was not able to find the reason.
  As workaround I commented out this pease of code!
  Must be considered when CubeMX generator is called!

- uSD Card Detect pin (PG2)
  Pin is configured but not listed in MX_Device.h

- Examples need to be tested
  Blinky works
  USB_Device HID works
